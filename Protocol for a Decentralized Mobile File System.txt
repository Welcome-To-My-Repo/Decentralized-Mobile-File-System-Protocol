1. INTRODUCTION_______________________________________________________

	The objective of the DMFS protocol is to exist as an
	alternative method of cloud storage. It will specifically
	make improvements regarding resource and security limitations
	that commonly occur in centralized cloud storage.

	The idea behind a DMFS is that any data shared between devices
	will only have meaning to the device it originated from. This
	allows the information in the DMFS to be scattered as widely
	as possible without being readable to attackers or loosing
	its recoverability to users.

2. OVERVIEW___________________________________________________________

	This section will cover information and concepts that
	universally pertain to the DMFS Protocol.

	2.1 TERMINOLOGY_______________________________________________

		This section lists terms that are specific to a DMFS.
		The list only includes simple definitions because more
		detail is provided in the sections below.

	DMFS
 		The acronym for Decentralized Mobile File System

	Block
 		The required universal format for moving stored
 		data in a DMFS.

	Remote Device
		Any computing device connected to a DMFS.

	Routing Device
		The device in a DMFS network responsible for
		facilitating connections between all devices
		in the network. A Routing Device is still a Remote
		Device, but it requires its own definition because
		of its unique role in a DMFS.

	Message ID
		A whole numerical value passed between Remote
		Devices that is used to represent specific
		messages.

	Message Type
		An organizational group that a Signal can belong
		to.

	2.2 THE BLOCK________________________________________________

		This section defines what a Block is. Information
		about how it's made and handled is included in other
		sections.

		Any data that is to be stored in the DMFS is passed
		between devices in the format of a Block. A Block
		contains a piece of a whole file, a header that
		carries information about the block, and one or more
		layers of encryption surrounding either the piece of
		a file or the whole block itself.

		Any Block that is not formed properly according to
		the parameters in this section will not be accepted
		by the DMFS.

		2.2.1 THE HEADER______________________________________

			The Header is a 432 bit section preceding the
			File section. It contains the following
			information in this order:

			256 bit ID number for the file that the
			File Section originated from.

			32 bit ID number for the block

			The 128 bit identifying number of the User
			the Block belongs to.

			The size of the file section in bytes
			stored by a 16 bit number. If the number is
			left at zero then the size of the file
			section is assumed to be 2 kilobytes.

			The Header is required to be exactly 432 bits
			long.

		2.2.2 THE FILE SECTION________________________________

			The File Section contains a 256 Kilobyte long
			section of a file.

		2.2.3 ENCRYPTION______________________________________

			A layer of encryption can be placed over any
			part of the Block, or around the complete
			Block.

			The Remote Deivce that applies the encryption
			to the Block is responsible for storing the
			keys to the encryption.

3. REMOTE DEVICE NETWORK FUNCTIONS____________________________________

	All communications between devices in a DMFS are performed
	using a TCP connection. The act of communication happens
	through the use of Message IDs. These are whole numerical
	values sent from one Remote Device to another through the TCP
	connection. They're used to represent specific messages that
	would be sent through the network.

	All message IDs are sent in ASCII form to avoid endianness
	confusion.

	A Message ID can represent the state of a Remote Device, a
	request for data, or an error. A Signal cannot be used to
	pass data that's stored in the DMFS. Message IDs are grouped
	into the following types:

	DEVICE STATE

		 100 - Message Received
			Returned if the previous signal has been
			successfully processed.

		 101 - declares itself a Routing Device
			Sent in response to Signal 202 if device is a
			Routing Device

		 102 - declares itself a Remote Device
			Sent in response to Signal 202 if device is a
			Remote Device

		 103 - resources available
			this message is sent to tell the receiving
			Remote Device that the sending Device has
			resources available for the receiving Device
			to use.

		 ... - EMPTY
			The following values have no messages assigned

	REQUEST

		 200 - request for Block
			This signal is sent followed by the ID number
			of the block. Only one ID number can follow
			this Signal as it represents a request for
			only one block.

		 201 - request for multiple blocks
			This signal is followed by any amount of ID
			numbers.

		 202 - request what type of device
			Sent to determine if the receiving device is a
			Routing or Remote Device.

		 203 - request memory for storage
			this messsage is sent to let the receiving
			Remote Device know that the sending Device
			wants to store a block.
			This message communicates the intent to store
			only a single Block.

		 204 - 	request credentials
		 	this message is sent to an unauthenticated
			Remote Device. That device will then send
			the hashes of its username and password.

		 ... - EMPTY
			The follwoing values have no messages assigned

	ERROR
		 300 - generic "process failed" error
			A catch all Signal that is returned when an
			unknown error has occurred when a Remote
			Device is attempting to satisfy a request.

		 301 - Block not found
			Returned and followed by the ID number of the
			missing Block in response to Signals 200 and
			201. This should not prevent the Remote Device
			from returning Blocks that are present.

		 302 - insufficient permission
			Returned when a Remote Device cannot satisfy a
			request because the requesting Remote Device
			is not the owner of the Block and the Block's
			permissions do not support the Remote Device's
			access.

		 303 - request signal out of order
			Returned when there is missing data or
			communication that should have preceded the
			request.

		 304 - not enough resources
			Returned when the Remote Device cannot satisfy
			the request because it lacks computing
			resources

		 305 - not enough memory
			Returned when a Remote Device cannot store the
			data given to it because it lacks the memory.

		 ... - EMPTY
			The following values have no messages assigned

	ROUTING

		 400 - request IP address
			Sent to the Routing Device. The Routing Device
			sould return a single IP address of a Remote
			Device in the DMFS.

		 401 - request multiple IP addresses
			Sent to the Routing Device followed by the
			number of IP addresses being requested. The
			Routing Device should return that number of
			IP addresses.

		 402 - request authentication
			send by the Routing Device to a Remote Device
			in order to allow a certain action

		 403 - request to join DMFS
			sent to the Routing Device by a Remote Device
			that wants to join the DMFS.

		 404 - authenticate this device
			This message is used by a Remote Device to
			request that the Routing Device verify the
			user account of a third Remote Device. After
			this message is sent, the first Remote Device
			will supply the IP address of the third Remote
			Device that needs authentication.

		405 - Device is verified
			This message is sent in response to Message
			404. If the Remote Device in question is an
			authentic user.

		 ... - EMPTY
			The following values have no messages assigned

	Note that not all numbers within the Signal Types have been
	used. This allows more signals to be added in future versions
	of the DMFS Protocol.

	If a Signal has already been assigned a number, it cannot be
	assigned to a new number. Additionally, each signal requires a
	unique number. If a new signal is added to the Protocol, it
	should be added to the next consecutive available number in
	its Type.

	3.1 COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONS___________________________________

		A Remote Device may accept as many connections to
		other Remote Devices as its system can handle.
		After receiving any message or data, the Remote Device
		should return Message 100 to the sending Device. If
		the receiving Device doesn't return Message 100, the
		sending Device should repeat sending the data or
		message until it receives Message 100. Message 100
		should never be returned in response to another
		Message 100.

		3.1.1 DATA REQUESTING_________________________________

			This is the simplest function. A requesting
			Device can send any Message from the 200 group
			and the holding Device will send the
			information requested.

		3.1.2 BLOCK SENDING AND RECEIVING_____________________

			In order to send a Block to another Device,
			the sending Device needs to first send a
			request for resources from the receiving
			Device. The receiving Device can either
			respond saying resources are available or
			giving an error that resources aren't
			available.

			If the receiving Device gave an affirmative,
			the sending Device will send a single Block.
			When requesting a Block the process of asking
			for resources is skipped. The requesting
			Device requests a Block from the holding
			Device. The holding Device then sends the
			Block.

		3.1.3 REMOTE DEVICE AUTHENTICATION____________________

			If a Remote Device encounters another Remote
			Device that needs authentication, it will send
			message 404 to the Routing Device along with
			the IP address of the unauthenticated Routing
			Device. The Routing Device will then send
			message 204 to the Remote Device. If the
			Remote Device is authenticated, the Routing
			Device will return message 405 to the Remote
			Device that originally sent message 404.

			The following processes require
			authentication:

				-storing Blocks in a Remote Device

				-any request to a Routing Device

	3.2 ROUTING FUNCTIONS_________________________________________

		A Routing Device can be included in a DMFS network
		that's managed by a separate Routing Device. It can
		also include separate Routing Devices in its network.

		Currently only one acting Routing Device per DMFS is
		supported by this protocol. This will change in later
		versions.

		Routing Devices are capable of acting as a
		traditional internet server. It will support a Domain
		Name and will accept http traffic. Domain Names for
		Routing Devices must be stored as an SRV record.

		3.2.1 ADDING DEVICES__________________________________

			A Remote Device that is not included in a DMFS
			can send Message 403 to a Routing Device. The
			Routing Device will expect the Remote Device
			to then send a Username and a Password. They
			should be sent to the Routing Device
			separately.

		3.2.2 REQUESTING IP ADDRESSES_________________________

			When a Remote Device needs to communicate with
			a second Remote Device, it asks the Routing
			Device for one or more IP addresses.

		3.2.3 ROUTING DEVICE AUTHENTICATION___________________

			If a Routing Device encounters an
			unauthenticated Remote Device, it will send
			message 204 to it. If the Remote Device is
			verified, then the Routing Device will
			continue.

	3.3 ALTERNATIVE CONNECTION METHODS____________________________

		The default path of interaction between Remote Devices
		is through an internet connection. Other remote
		technologies can be used as well such as a Bluetooth
		or Cellular connection.

		3.3.1 ALTERNATE CONNECTION BEHAVIOR___________________

			Because other connections may not give as easy
			access to all Remote Devices in a DMFS as an
			internet connection can, a Remote Device using
			a supported alternative connection will have
			to modify how it connects to the DMFS.
			[explain modified behavior in Version 0.2]

	3.4 CONNECTION ERRORS_________________________________________

		If two Remote Devices are interacting and the
		connection is suddenly lost, the Remote Device that
		initiated the interrupted interaction will be
		responsible for re-initiating the interaction again.

		3.4.1 ROUTING DEVICE CHANGES IP ADDRESSES_____________

			If the Routing Device(s) for the DMFS have a
			domain name, then the Remote Devices can
			simply interact through the URL associated
			with the DMFS regardless of the individual
			addresses of the Routing Devices.

			If the Routing Device(s) changes addresses and
			the Remote Devices were relying on it's IP
			address to interact with it, there is no sure
			way to recover the network. Each device in the
			DMFS should keep a list of recently connected
			IP addresses so that if the network fails,
			Remote Devices can share connections that
			still work with each other.

4. DATA STORAGE FUNCTIONS_____________________________________________

	4.1 UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING PROCESSES_______________________

		This section describes the processes of moving
		information into a DMFS.

	4.2 ALLOCATION________________________________________________

		When Blocks are being stored in a DMFS, Remote Devices
		that spend more time on average connected will receive
		more Blocks. This increases the stability of the
		DFMS as it increases the Accessibility of the
		information stored in the DMFS.

5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT________________________________________________

	All Remote Devices preform resource management tasks.

	5.1 STORAGE MANAGEMENT________________________________________

		A DMFS works by distributing the task of storing
		information to all the devices in the network.
		Each Remote Device must make at least one Gigabyte of
		its storage permanently available for use by the DMFS.
		This reserved storage is where the Remote Device must
		store all Blocks that it accepts. This portion of
		storage can be released from use when the Remote
		Device permanently ceases to be a part of any DMFS.

		If a Remote Device has already reserved storage for a
		DMFS and then joins another DMFS, it is not required
		to enlarge its current portion of storage or make a
		new portion. Remote Devices can use the same portion
		of storage for multiple DMFS networks.

		When a Remote Device has used all its portion of
		storage, it must notify the Routing Devices of all
		DMFS networks it's connected to that it has no storage
		available. The Remote Device has the choice to enlarge
		its portion of storage or wait until Blocks are
		removed and it has storage available again. In the
		event that the Remote Device is able to store more
		Blocks again, it must sent a message to the Routing
		Devices of all the DMFS networks that it's connected
		to that it has resources available.

	5.2 ACCESS CONTROL__________________________________

		A DMFS can exist in two different forms, open and
		secured. An open DMFS will accept any Remote Device
		into the network. A secured DMFS will only accept
		Remote Devices with the correct credentials and uses
		a basic username and password authentication system.

		Routing Devices are responsible for authentication in
		a secured DMFS. Every Remote Device will keep a list
		of the usernames and passwords associated with each
		Remote Device. Both the username and password will be
		recorded only as a hash. The username is encrypted to
		prevent any information about the Remote Devices being
		usable if the Routing Device is compromised.

		When a Remote Device is being authenticated, it must
		send its username and password to other devices.
		In order to protect their integrity, only the hashes
		of these credentials will be sent. This way the
		Routing Device can still authenticate the Remote
		Device by comparing the hashes it receives.
